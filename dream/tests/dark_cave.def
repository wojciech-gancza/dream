The cave is really dark
You see barly nothing. The cave is really dark. After a while you seem to see a shadows in the darkness but you cannot realize what it can be. You see no way out and no possiblility to move safely.

touch THEN PRINT You feel wet stone walls. A lot of wet stones. Wet stones ewerywhere. Moment! You feel something like thick wire.
smell THEN PRINT It is wet but air seems to be fresh. Maybe better call it - well preserved.
